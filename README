To run the binomial Naive Bayes classifier, using frequency cutoff with 2000 words
for feature selection, run the following script:

python cw1_base.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To find out the 30 most informative features for classification, run:

python q1.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To see the two movie reviews described in section 2 of the report incorrectly
classified, run:

python q2.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To test the impact different values of k have with FREQUENCY CUTOFF, then
you can run the following script:

python q3a.py <numFeaturesTouse> <filterStopWords>

where <numFeaturesToUse> is a positive integer which determines the number
of features used for classification (value of k) and <filterStopWords> is
a flag that decides if function words are exluded form the corpus. If
<filterStopWords> = true, then function words will be excluded. Otherwise,
they will be included in feature selection, extraction and classification.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To test the impact different values of k have with MUTUAL INFORMATION, then
you can run the following script:

"python q3b.py <numFeaturesTouse> <filterStopWords>"

where <numFeaturesTouse> and <filterStopWords> have the same use as they
do in q3a.py.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To test the accuracy of classifiers which use some of the additional features
described in section 4 of the report (WordNet features), the following script
can be used:

python q4.py <featureSetToUse> <numFeaturesToUse>

where <numFeaturesToUse> is the value of k to use for frequency cutoff feature
selection and <featureSetToUse> determines which WordNet-related features to
use.

Possible Feature Sets:
		word -- Exact word occurrences considered
		syn -- Synonyms of words considered
		hyp -- Hypernyms of words considered
		word-adj -- Get all adjective meanings of words. If one of those adjectives
			   is the same as a word feature, consider that adjective as being in
			   the document (MUST BE USED WITH "word" feature set)

These can be combined using "-". For example, to consider words, synoynms
and hypernyms, use "word-syn-hyp".
