## Natural Language Processing Coursework 2 (Compound Trigrams)

This coursework was how to detect the branching in compound trigrams. The
definition of "compound trigram" and "branching" is specified in the
`nlp-cw2-specifiation.pdf` document in this directory.

Which techniques were tested, and which were effective, is detailed in
`nlp-cw2.pdf`. This is generated by running `make` in this directory.

The rest of this README explains how to run the associated Python scripts.

### Testing "Most Frequent Compound" Supervised Classifier

To train and run the "most frequent compound" supervised classifier, run the
following command:

```
python compound_bracket_classifier.py <unlabelledDataset> <labelledDataset>
```

where `unlabelledDataset` is the dataset containing unlabelled compound
trigrams to label and `labelledDataset` is the dataset that contains the
same compound trigrams (in the same order) which also contains the correct
labels.

Running the command will output the accuracy of the classifier.

> Examples of `unlabelledDataset` and `labelledDataset` are provided in this
> directory. They are  `lauer.test` and `lauer.gold` respectively.

### Testing "Most Frequent Bigram" Unsupervised Classifier

To train and run the "most frequent bigram" unsupervised classifier, run the
following command:

```
python unsupervised_classifier.py <unlabelledDataset> <labelledDataset>
```

where `unlabelledDataset` is the dataset containing unlabelled compound
trigrams to label and `labelledDataset` is the dataset that contains the
same compound trigrams (in the same order) which also contains the correct
labels.

Running the command will output the accuracy of the classifier.

> The unsupervised classifier is training on bigrams from the famous Brown
> corpus.
