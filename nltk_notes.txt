How to determine the GENRE and TOPIC of text?

Could look at the frequency, relative frequency or cumulative frequency of the
different token types in the text. However, these are often jumbled with
English "plumbing" words, such as "the", "a", "then". They tell you nothing
about what the actual text is talking about (e.g. whale is only topic-relate
word in top 50 words in Jonah and the Whale).

Alternatively, he could ook at all the HAPAXES. Hapaxes are words which
only occur once in a given text - outliers. However, the problem with
this is that they don't really tell you anything about the topic as they're
exceptions. Plus, a lot of them are very rare words whose meaning is difficult
to derive without the context in which it is used.

NEITHER FREQUENCT OR INFREQUENT WORDS HELP! WHAT DO WE USE???

Try searching for long words (perhaps they contain more content in general?)
NO. Since long words tend to be hapaxes anyway, so we're back to words
that are just outliers and only occur once or twice.

INSTEAD we should look for words that are above a certain length that
have a certain frequency. That way, we get words that aren't just outliers,
but are more likely to give a better idea on what the overall content
is about since it's not going to be just be "plumbing" words (typically short).

COLLOCATIONS

These are pairs of words that are paired together, an UNUSUAL amount. This
also implies if you swapped out one of the words for another, that pair
would be INFREQUENT (the pair is very specific to both words, one of the
words isn't just a "plumbing" word like "a").



DEFINITIONS
-----------
antecedent = this precedes a pronoun (e.g. they) to determine the SUBJECT of the verb
             . The dogs were said. They ran away.
              the "ran" verb's subject is "dogs" as defined by "they". (OBJECT is away)
